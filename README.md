This project explores the concept of Layer 2 protocols as a solution to the scalability limitations of blockchains. Businesses rely on fast, secure, and reliable information transactions, which current blockchain technology often struggles to deliver due to scaling issues.

Advantages of Blockchain:
Transparency: Information is stored in a public ledger accessible only to authorized members, ensuring transparency and trust.
Integrity: Data immutability guarantees the integrity of stored information.
Blockchain Scalability Challenges:
Limited transaction capacity: Current blockchains can only handle a limited number of transactions per second, hindering wider adoption.
Introducing Layer 2 Protocols:
Off-chain processing: These protocols process transactions outside the main blockchain, alleviating load and increasing overall throughput.
Popular examples:
Bitcoin Lightning Network: Enables micropayments with fast confirmation times.
Ethereum Raiden: Facilitates fast off-chain payments on the Ethereum network.
Ethereum Plasma: Creates sidechains with independent transaction processing and verification.
Optimistic Rollups: Bundle transactions off-chain, optimistically assuming their validity, with a mechanism for dispute resolution.
Project Contribution:
Comparison of Layer 2 protocols: Analyzes the strengths, weaknesses, and use cases of various Layer 2 solutions.
Dummy implementation using Plasma: Provides a hands-on example to illustrate the functionality of a specific Layer 2 protocol.
Future Work:
Expand the comparison: Include additional Layer 2 protocols and emerging solutions.
Evaluate real-world implementations: Analyze performance and adoption of existing Layer 2 applications.
